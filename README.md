As you can see, the card works on both desktop and mobile devices. This is very important, since currently most visits to websites are made from a smartphone.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- VS Code

### What I learned

With this exercise I put into practice my knowledge about flexbox and its properties. Being a newbie to this interesting world, it took me some work to center the elements correctly, but in the end I was able to achieve it using "align-items: center" and "justify-content: center"

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
#main-content {
  width: 100%;
  height: 95vh;
  box-sizing: content-box;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
}
```

### Continued development

In the future, I would like to learn more about flex containers as, in my opinion, they are the basis for responsive development of any website.
